<p style="color: #f8c272;text-align:justify;padding: 0px 80px 0px 70px;font-family:Geneva;font-size:120%;">
	I have to admit finding a problem is harder than it seems, our first topic problem was to broad, so we changed it entirely to a topic that my groupmates and I are interested and familiar with. And that is how to deal with toxicity in the gaming community and we didn’t have a hard time conceptualizing possible quotes and pain points. </p>
	
<p style="color: #f8c272;text-align:justify;padding: 0px 80px 0px 70px;font-family:Geneva;font-size:120%;">
	However, we had the same problem as the first topic, and we needed to specify more. Thus, finally we have a concrete topic and with the approval of Ma’am Jenn. </p>

<p style="color: #f8c272;text-align:justify;padding: 0px 80px 0px 70px;font-family:Geneva;font-size:120%;">
	After the night consultation, we started to brainstorm and during the brainstorming it had occurred to me how it was somewhat easy when the topics has been broken-down / specified. </p>

<p style="color: #f8c272;text-align:justify;padding: 0px 80px 0px 70px;font-family:Geneva;font-size:120%;">
	Our final topic issue is purchasing of videogames or console via website, to be specific selling and buying of secondhand games/console. We came up with a goal that the transactions are simple and easy, and to promote and appreciate the old console/games.</p>

<p style= "color: #f8c272;text-align:justify;padding: 0px 80px 0px 70px;font-family:Geneva;font-size:120%;">
	When it comes to creating the quotes, we thought all the different problems that different kind of people may encounter such as a collector, a parent, gamer, even a simple person who would like to feel the gaming experience.</p>
