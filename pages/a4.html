	<b style="color:#FB9334ff";>1. How can we improve it?</b><br><br>- Use of words such as "delectable" and "nibbles" could be confusing.<br><br>- "when: june 30th, 2012 at 9:30pm. Where: the pad" not organized properly, though when is specified but the where part is vague. Should put the address instead.<br><br>- "if you need direction, ping us" and "Kindly let us know if youâ€™ll be attending by June 1st" no phone number is shown so how else will the people contact them especially on a vague place is indicated.<br></p>

	<b style="color:#FB9334ff";>2. What would be the objective function?</b><br><br>- The passage is about a couples after-dinner party.<br><br>- The objective is an invitation to the party. Thus, informing invited guest to when and where the party will take place. Also letting the host know if the guest will be attending by giving them a confirmation before the event will take place. <br></p>

	For what I did, I was thinking on a back to back invitation. For the front page is just the main theme also adding the host's name and, on the bottom, left a small "details on the back" one cannot miss this message.</p>

	And on the back, is where all the details for instance the date is indicated as well as the address to the place. And a message about letting the host know who will be attending. And the contact number below, I added two numbers indicating one could be Roberts and one could be Alexandra's. So that the invited guest will have two options. </p>
