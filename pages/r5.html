	When analyzing the activity 4: invitation "How can we improve this?", at first, I did not know if it was a wedding after dinner party because two names of the opposite sex were given. Then when it stated "wine and nibbles" I immediately thought of a grown up get together hence that alcohol is included. Though the before party could be any event and that Robert and Alexandra's is hosting an after-dinner party at their house, thus I just went a generic after-dinner party.</p>

	As shown on the presentation, the statement was broken down into their respective categories such as description, when, where, and a note from the host. Although breaking the text down would be ideal and a great way to organize it, for what I did I directly went and tried to understate the statement then organizing it.</p>

	The challenge given was an exercise to my brain. The first <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"I am a jelly donut"</b> I got this immediately however,<br><br>

the <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Jake spoke in Berlin"</b> this was harder to identity because I could not make out the last part immediately I could only figure out "Be", but then when rereading it once more noticed that the <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Spoke (in)"</b> and <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Berl(in)"</b> they had a similar <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"in"</b> line or placement so I figured it was <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Berlin"</b>. </p>

	<b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"THE CAT"</b> was fairly easy only some part of it was blocking/missing and I could fully understand it either way.<br><br>

	<b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"TAE CHT"</b> would have been harder if I hadnâ€™t known about "The Cat" previously, anagrams are my weakness most of the time.
