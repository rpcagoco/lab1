<h1 style="color:#3895d3;text-align:center;font-family:Optima;font-size:220%;">R5: Color Theory and Typography</h1>

	There is nothing more embarrassing than having to read something wrong in front of live television. Especially, if it an award show, having that kind of mistake can rewrite history in the movie industry or any show that could patiently ruin talented people. And having a bad typography can correlate to this.

	An example would be the Miss Universe 2015, when Steve Harvey mistakenly read Miss Columbia instead of Miss Philippines. Upon seeing the elimination card, it was just an awful design with every font the same font and a bland placement on the <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"2nd Runner Up"</b>, <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"1nd Runner Up"</b> and <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"MISS UNIVERSE 2015"</b> it is organized but they could look similar when just glancing on the card.

	After watching <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Why is this font every?"</b> I didn't recognize the name of the font at first, but I did recognize the font and it is called <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Cooper Black"</b>. A little fun fact I first came to know about this font from my favorite album called <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>"Electra Heart"</b> way back in 2012 and started to use that font to print out my name and such.

	I could totally see how it is so appealing throughout the past decades it has a round like balloon look, which I guess back in the 1920’s it was something new and different, it wasn’t straight and stiff like <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>Copperplate Gothic</b>. Cooper Black is designed by <b style="color:#c8c8d2";>Oswald Bruce Cooper</b> and apparently he got inspired from many imitations. Nonetheless, little did Oswald Cooper it has become one of the most popular fonts to this day, even though people may not know what it is called but see it everyone as stated on the video.

	One of the game activities <a style="color:#c8c8d2" href="http://brandseenapp.com/">Brandseenapp.com</a> was such an eye opening for me. I thought I knew the brand so well that I could give the right color however I did get the Batman logo and the Apple logo correct it was just bright yellow for the Batman logo and black for the Apple logo but for the rest I had a hard time particularly  IBM and Dropbox, to be fair I rarely interact with these brand/company so I won’t be able to know their colors right away.
