<h1 style="text-align:center;">Personal Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Richelle Cagoco. When it comes to introducing myself people tend to mispronounce my name which I am already used to. But you can call me <b>"Richie"</b> sfor short, one of my good friends gave me that nickname and I just went along with it.</p>

<p>I don't have a much knowledge of coding as of now though I do know a HTML, Java, and still learning Python.</p>
