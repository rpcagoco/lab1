<h1 style="text-align:center;">Personal Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Richelle Cagoco. When it comes to introducing myself people tend to mispronounce my name which I am already used to. But you can call me <b>"Richie"</b> sfor short, one of my good friends gave me that nickname and I just went along with it.</p>

<p>So far during this quarantine, I havenâ€™t been doing so much. My daily quarantine routine is waking up at noon and surf the net and at night I would play an online game with friends.</p>

<p>My love for video games started when I got my first console (PS3) back in 2011. And one of my first game was Uncharted an adventure action pack game. Then after I tried different types of genres such as sports and etc. However, my favorite genre would be story-based games. And my favorite game of all time would be The last of Us.</p>
