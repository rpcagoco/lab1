<p style="text-align:left;font-family:courier;font-size:120%;">Hello, my name is Richelle P. Cagoco. When it comes to introducing myself people tend to mispronounce my name which I am already used to. But one can call me <b>"Richie"</b> instead. Fun fact: one of my good friends gave me that nickname and it just kind of stuck.</p>

<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:courier;font-size:120%;">When it comes to my educational background. I am second year college student studying in <b>Asia Pacific College (APC)</b>, taking up <b>Entertainment Multimedia Computing</b>: specializing in <b>Game Developement</b>. </p>

<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:courier;font-size:120%;">I don't have a much knowledge of coding as of now though I do know HTML, Java, and still learning Python. And I goal of mine is to better understand and improve myself in coding hopefully by the end of this school year.</p>
